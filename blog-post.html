                                <p style="text-indent:30px">A family is a group constituting of parents and their children; it is a group of related people or things. The family is God’s idea because it gives 3 important or basic things to every individual;</p> 
                                1.  Identity<br>
                                2.  Inheritance<br>
                                3.  Value<br>
                                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Identity: it is through the family that everyone gets identity. Eg. If you go to a community and you are looking for a person, you can find such a person by saying the family’s name such as Nwankwo family, Osuala family etc. such a person is easily located.
                                Inheritance: In a village, anytime there is a sharing of anything in a kingdred people start getting potion based on their families. This makes a family very important because without a family, somebody’s inheritance is at stake. Identifying with a family is very important, that is where a man’s inheritance is.
                                Value and Worth: A family gives its members value and worth. Value has to do with price and worth has to do with importance. Anytime we see people who go into society and begin to misbehave or create awareness, we have seen people who came from dysfunctional families because the family is an agent of transformation.
                                Anyone who does not identify with a family is referred to as a bastard and so it applies to both the physical and the spiritual. Therefore, there are two types of families;</p>
                                1.  Physical family<br>
                                2.  Spiritual family<br>

                                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">A man’s life begins in a family. God intends that before a man begins any dealing with God, he must be birthed into a family. In other words, God begins his work in a man’s life by settling him in a family (psalms 68:5-6). God’s intention was for family to be the place for the correction of such ills as hopelessness, low-self-esteem, identity crisis( not knowing who we are) etc. In other to restore society, the family life must be restored. God established his own family (the church or the body of christ) because the first family in Eden failed. </p>
                                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Every family has an entry point- Birth (john 1:12-13, 1 cor 15:44): if a man dies having experienced only the natural/physical birth experience, he is eternally separated from God. One of the major characteristics of the natural/physical family is that it is encompassed roundabout with corruption. The only entrance to God’s family is JESUS CHRIST (John 10:1, 7-9, Acts 4:12).</p> 
                                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">The Structure of God’s family ( Eph 2:19) Eph 3:14-15 ‘For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named.   God has one family divided into two- in Heaven and on Earth. The only difference is that the one on earth is limited by time and space, but both are under one family.. God’s family (Heb12:1).</p>

                                <h3 style="background-color: #adadad; text-align: center; text-transform: uppercase;">Characteristics of a family (John 14:6)</h3>
                                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Jesus said to him, “ I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me”</p>
                                1)The Way: the way simply means the method or manner of doing things. It can be the way of dressing, eating, celebration, recreation, worship etc. In God’s family, that Way is Jesus. When we need to communicate to our Father, we Pray (1 thess 5:17, Eph 6:18) so anytime a man is praying, he is talking with God. We also give thanks in everything and situation we find ourselves (Phil 4:6). We Rejoice (Phil 4:4), we also Forgive, (2cor 2: 10,11). Also there is also a Dress code in God’s Family (Eph 6:11), It is known as the whole Armor of God. We expose Darkness (Eph 5:11). We watch each other’s back (Gal 6:1-2). We honour and respect, we obey our parents etc.<br>
                                2) The Language: Human communicate through the structured use of words. Families have a communication system, and some even talk with codes which are familiar to them alone. God’s family language is Truth, founded still in Jesus (the Word of God) Eph 4:25. Truth is who God is and what God has said. Truth is pure! It cannot be contaminated. The members of God‘s family speak the truth and not in accordance to the situations but to God’s Word. What we say matters to our hearers, so we ask ourselves before we speak, what will Jesus say? and that is what we speak.<br>
                                3) The Life:  It simply means the existence of an individual. The traits found in family, form the kind of family that is why some are weak and some strong because of the trait that run in them. In God’s family, there are also some traits that run in the people and that’s the Life and the life is Jesus. One of the inherent trait in God’s family is Eternal Life.  (John 10:27-28, 1John 5:11-13). Eternal life guarantees that a man will never perish because Jesus gives eternal life. Eternal life is God’s kind of life and Jesus is the life we live in God’s family. Some elements of Eternal Life are: Health, Prosperity, Intelligence, Wisdom (right application of knowledge), Righteousness, Peace, Joy etc.<br>
                                <h5>If you have eternal life know this!</h5>
                                 <p>Sickness has no place in your life. There is no course you can fail, nor book you can’t understand. You’ve got sound mind, there is wisdom in the life you have. You have a position in Christ before God. God does not see you again, it’s Christ he sees when he looks at you.</p>
                                 All we need in God’s family is found in Jesus.
                                <p>JESUS IS EVERYTHING…
                                THE WAY.. TRUTH.

                                . AND LIFE!
